# Class-07 Reading Notes

## Domain Modeling Article:
= creating a model in code to solve a problem
This model describes:
- entities, their attributes and behaviors
- constraints that govern the problem

To Do List: 
1. build objects that are self-contained
1. model attributes with a constructor function 
    - this serves to define and initialize properties
1. methods should be small and have one job
1. create instances using 'new', then call the constructor function
1. store the object in a variable so you can call it globally later
1. use this.XXXXX to call properties from within an object

## HTML Tables
4 Key Elements to create tables:
1. <table> is used to make a table in HTML
1. <tr> indicates table row
1. <td> indicates table data
1. <th> indicates table heading

-rowspan spans more than one row
-colspan spans more than one column

Splitting the table into sections:
1. <thead> header area
1. <tbody> main table content
1. <tfoot> bottom or footer area of the table

## JavaScript - ch3: Functions, Methods and Objects
Two ways to create objects:
1. Object literals
1. Object constructor notation

Data is stored using key:value pairs. Can be in the form of:
1. an object
1. an array
1. arrays in objects
1. objects in arrays

Therea are some built-in objects in the browser such as String, Number, Math and Date.
