# Ch 10: Debugging JavaScript

The console can help you find errors.

Dev tools can help you find errors.

Order of execution matters.

Variables can be declared globally - available to the whole document; or locally - available only to the local function. 

Lexical scope - functions have access to variables defined within that function and any parent function that it may be residing in.

Types of errors:
1. Syntax error
1. Reference error
1. Eval error
1. URI error
1. Type error
1. Range error
1. Error
1. NaN

Can write error-handling code using try, catch, throw and finally statements. 

Creating console.log statements can help determine what parts of your code are working and which are not. 

Can also use conditional break points.
