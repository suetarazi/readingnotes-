# Class 03 Reading Notes:

## HTML - Ch 3 Lists
There can be two types of lists: ordered lists which are numbered and unordered lists
``` The tags are <ol> for ordered lists and will be listed numerically and
    <ul> for bulletted lists.
    <li> is the tag for a list item within a list. 
```
There are also denfinition lists: 
```
<dl> = definition list
<dt> = definition term
<dd> = actual definition
```
We can also nest our lists inside each other.

## HTML - Ch 13 Boxes
The following box specifications can be set in css:
width
height
    note can also specify min-width, max-width, min-height, max-height

Every box has 3 properties that can be controlled in css:
1. border
    can specify border width, style, color. 
1. margin
1. padding

Can also center text in a box with text-align;
CSS3 allows for : box shadows, a border image, round corners, make elliptical shapes, 

## JavaScript Ch 4  Decisions and Loops

Decisions can be determined using:
1. if else statements - check a condition and run a section of code if condition is met
2. switch statements - compare a value against certain outcomes
3. for while and do while loops - allow for itteration

All 3 check a condition and if that condition is met, the following section of code is executed. 
Loops allow you to itterate through a sequence by creating a loop counter and deciding how big of an iteration it will make. ```i++```
