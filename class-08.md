# Class 08 Notes

## HTML Ch 7 - Forms
- used to collect info from visitors
- Types of form controls include: text input, pswd input, text box, radio buttons, checkboxes, drop-down menus, submit buttons, image buttons, file upload buttons
syntax: name=value pairs.
```
use the <form> tag. Every <form> tag requires an action element. 
forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post. 
<input> tag specifies user input. Can specify type, such as text or password, or text area, radiobutton, checkbox, etc, as well as maxlength
```

## CSS ch 14 - Lists, Tables and Forms
There are several CSS properties that are used to control the appearance of lists, tables and forms. 
- List markers use the list-style-type 
- Can also style image properties
- Can specify types of bullets used or numbering
- Can add background or borders to table cells
- Can change the appearance of forms

## JavaScript ch 6 - Events
- interactions from the user such as a click on a link, swipe, etc create events.
- events trigger functions to get called and code to be run
- the code then responds to the user's input by reacting to the DOM
- Event handlers
- Event listeners
- Event flow - this only matters if event handlers are on an element and one of its ancestor or descentant elements.
