### HTML, CSS and JavaScript

HTML (hypertext markup language) has been around for years and has undergone several iterations. Currently, we are working towards HTML5, which is estimated to be the standard by the early 2020â€™s. Nevertheless, several browsers started supporting HTML5 a few years ago and so some developers have started using these features. HTML5 will change how sites are built and make different use of the `<div>` tag. 



CSS came along after HTML and stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This is essentially code that can sit within a `<style>` tag at the top of an HTML document that adds rules to the HTML about how the content will be presented. For example: borders, colors, fonts, style, box dimensions, etc. are all laid out in CSS. This allows one to use the same style sheet throughout their site. 



JavaScript determines how a site will behave. Pages can be made to be interactive for the end user and enhances the usability of the site. Variables must be declared in JavaScript and can then be utilized within functions to perform a specific task.
