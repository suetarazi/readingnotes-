# CSS Ch 15: Layout
Layout controls where each element sits on a page. 
```
<div> tag is used to create sections in layout. 
```

Can also have blocks within a block: child blocks in a parent block. 

4 ways to position elements:
1. normal flow - what browsers default to unless otherwise specified
1. relative positioning - shifts an element up, down, L or R
1. absolute positioning - content moves as the user scrolls up or down
1. float - moves content L or R. need width to be defined. Can be used in multi-column layouts. 

* Note browser defaults to normal flow unless you specify relative, abosolute or fixed.

Pages are 960-1000px wide. The reader knows what the site is about within the top 600px.
