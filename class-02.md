HTML elements can be used to describe the structure of the page such as headings and paragraphs. Some examples of tags that identify structure are: 
```
<h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6> are different sizes of headings (largest to smallest)
<b> bold
<i> italicize
<sup> superscript
<sub> subscript
<p> paragraph
```

Other HTML elements are used to for semantic markup, which serve to describe where emphasis may be placed, things in quotes, etc. Some examples are:
```
<strong> item of importance
<em> item of emphasis
<blockquote> quote that takes an entire paragraph
<q> shorter quote
<abbr> abbreviation
<cite> citation
<dfn> definition
<address> address
<ins> insertion
<del> deletion
<s> something that is no longer accurate, but should not be deleted
```
